[{"content":"A personal site could do much with your interview and make you more competitive! In this paper I would share with you detailed steps for how to create a new public site using hugo, which is one of latest tools for building a site.\nGit\nGo \u0026gt; 1.11\nbrew install hugo or\nport install hugo if you are using MacPorts.\nThen you can simply jump to step 2 to continue.\nchoco install hugo -confirm or for the extended version:\nchoco install hugo-extended -confirm If you are using Scoopfor package management, you can install Hugo with following:\nscoop install hugo or\nscoop install hugo-extended for extended version.\nLinux can use Homebrew with the following one-liner:\nbrew install hugo which is the same as in Mac.\nhugo version it would show something that begin with:\nHugo Static Site Generator v0.79.0-1415EFDC and you can then go to the next step!\nhugo new site \u0026lt;name of your blog project\u0026gt; to initalize your blog.\nIn this example, I just name by blog project (it is not the name of the site) as \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo; and I could use the command:\nhugo new site blog to init it.\nat this stage, the project would be created at the path that you execute this command.\nIf you check the name of folders in the current path you could find a new folder named \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo; (or the naem you gave to it).\n\u0026gt;ls ... d----- 16/12/2020 11:16 AM blog ... (this is the way of windows showing the folder info).\nThen we enter the folder.\n\u0026gt;cd blog blog/\u0026gt;ls you could see the items that hugo has initialized for you.\nbasic toturial which is very time consuming and inefficient. Instead we can download existing themes that designed by others and make improvements based on it! themes.gohugo.io offers a wide range of themes that you could choose from.\nIn this example I would just choose one of it for demo.\n\r\rstack_theme\r\nOften there are detailed info about how to download it below the basic info of the theme.\nIn this example, it suggests me to use git to clone this theme under by site folder.\ngit clone https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/ themes/hugo-theme-stack then go to the themes/hugo-theme-stack/exampleSite and use the config inside the folder to replace the config.toml in the site root folder. Alternatively you can copy everything in the example site and overwrite things in your site root folder for a quicker start.\nFor some themes that using .yaml instead of .toml, you can delete the config.toml in the root folder and only leave the config.yaml provided by the theme as hugo is compatible of reading various format of config files.\nhugo server -t hugo-theme-stack --buildDrafts or simply\nhugo server if you have overwrite config.toml in the root folder.\nThe terminal would tell you the local address to visit your site.\nStart building sites … | EN -------------------+----- Pages | 27 Paginator pages | 0 Non-page files | 2 Static files | 0 Processed images | 8 Aliases | 13 Sitemaps | 1 Cleaned | 0 Built in 725 ms Watching for changes in \\blog\\{archetypes,assets,content,data,layouts,static,themes} Watching for config changes in \\blog\\config.yaml Environment: \u0026quot;development\u0026quot; Serving pages from memory Running in Fast Render Mode. For full rebuilds on change: hugo server --disableFastRender Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1) Now you can go to the address and have a look with your new site!\nhugo new post/[name of your blog]/index.md create the basic structure of your blog.\nps: you could also simply use:\nhugo new post/[name].md to create your new post, but then if you want to attach images to your posts you would need to putting them mixed, which would increase the difficulty of maintence in the long run.\nThen you could go to the /post/ folder and edit the .md file using various tools that supports reading markdown file. Those .md would be the content of your post.\ntitle: the title of your post, you can edit as you wish, remember using quote if your title include spaces in it.\ndate: the time that the post was created, you could often leave it.\ndraft: true\nthis means this post is in draft mode, and would not included when building (mentioned later) you can leave it and avtivate \u0026ndash;buildDrafts flag when building the site or simply delete it if you think it is unnecessary.\nApart from these attributes, there are also some other attributes that can be included in the header:\ndescription: this part can be the subtitle of the post.\nslug: the slug of the post.\nimage: the image you want to put at the top of the post.\ncategories: the categories that you want to add to this post.\ntags: the tage of the post.\nThe format of using categories is:\ncategories: - Test - toturial or\ncategories: [Test,toturial] In this case, this post is categorized as Test and toturial on the site.\nthere may be more attributes that could be added in the header, you can find them here.\nhugo to build the site locally. (converting everything into html to get ready for deployment).\nTo put your site into Internet, you first need a respority to store all you resources for your site. Here we choose github as such store.\nwww.github.com\nor if you still not have one, register here.\n\r\rnew repo\r\nNote: the name of the repo has to be the same as your accout nick name.\nThe format of the repo name should be:\n[your username in lower case].github.io For example:\n\r\rrepo name\r\nensure that your repo is public so that other can visit your site!\n\r\rpub\r\nleave other as default or add anything you like in description.\nNow you get a empty repo ready to store your site contents!\nBuilding the site by overwriting baseUrl and theme.\nhugo --theme=hugo-theme-stack --baseUrl=\u0026quot;https://[your username].github.io\u0026quot; --buildDrafts (you can ignore the \u0026ndash;buildDrafts flag if you removed draft attributes in your posts that your wish to build)\nNow there would be a new folder named /public/ in your root folder.\nenter the public/ folder.\ncd public All contents in the public/ folder are contents that hugo built for you, you then just need to upload everything in this public/ folder to the remote repo.\nWe use git to complete this step:\nblog/public\u0026gt;git init blog/public\u0026gt;git add . blog/public\u0026gt;git commit -m \u0026quot;initial upload\u0026quot; blog/public\u0026gt;git remote add origin [your repo address for your site] blog/public\u0026gt;git push -u origin master then enter your username and password for your github account.\nWhen the push completed, you should be able to access your personal site without much trouble!\nYou can modify the strucure of the existing theme or even create on your own!
